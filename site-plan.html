        <h3>Typography</h3>
            <h4>Heading Font: Fjalla One</h4>
                <p>It has a bold but clean look, making it easy to read and gives
                distinct, leading headings.
                </p>
            <h4>Paragraph Font: Krub</h4>
                <p>Again, as a sans serif font, it provides a clean, easy to read font.<br>
                It's also a lighter script making it easy to follow as main text 
                from the headers. </p>
            <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
                <p>The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers
                rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.
                Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
                Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.</p>
            <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
                <p class="colored">Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively
                for physically fit and experienced rafters.
                No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking,
                White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you.</p>
